MicroStrategy’s Embedding SDK Playground is the one-stop shop for developers to build impactful, interactive analytics experiences that integrate seamlessly with websites and applications.

Just use the intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces to define the perfect user experience, test it out in real time, and then let the platform automatically generate the code for you. You’ll turn your application into platform for Intelligence Everywhere in no time.

Start building your application using the [Embedding SDK Playground](https://microstrategy.github.io/playground/). The [Playground User Manual](https://github.com/MicroStrategy/playground) provides the instructions for how to get started.
