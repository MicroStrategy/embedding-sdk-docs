There are examples hosted on [GitHub](https://microstrategy.github.io/embedding-sdk-samples/), from the simple example to showcase one specific feature of Embedding SDK to more complicated application with a lot of integration with MicroStrategy's REST API and third-party SDK.

MicroStrategy REST API is the backbone of MicroStrategyâ€™s open architecture. MicroStrategy REST API is widely used in the examples. For more information about MicroStrategy REST API, please visit [the documentation](https://microstrategy.github.io/rest-api-docs/), play with the live [API Explorer](https://demo.microstrategy.com/MicroStrategyLibrary/api-docs/index.html), and play with our [REST API Playground](https://github.com/MicroStrategy/rest-api-playground).
